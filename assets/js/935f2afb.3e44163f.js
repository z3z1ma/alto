However, it is helpful to move beyond the quickstart and see a more contrived example of what a real project might look like. This will expose you to some more of the possibilities of Alto. While the rest of the learning content will have toml, yaml, and json examples, we will use toml in this brief exposure to a more refined and terse config file. Exposure is the key here, so don\'t worry about understanding everything right away. We will cover the details in the next section.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integrations/intro":{"id":"integrations/intro","title":"Overview","description":"Integrations are based entirely on the Singer ecosystem. Singer is an open source specification for the interchange format between a data extractor and a data loader referred to as taps and targets respectively. Due to the open nature of the specification, there are many taps and targets available. The Singer ecosystem is a great place to start if you are looking for a way to extract data from a source or load data into a destination without writing any code. The best source for the available taps and targets is the Meltano Hub. The Meltano Hub is a community driven repository of Singer tap and target metadata. They expose metadata describing what configuration options are available for each tap and target and have a nice user interface. Outside of the Meltano Hub, GitHub is a great place to search for Singer taps and targets.","sidebar":"integrationsSidebar"},"integrations/taps":{"id":"integrations/taps","title":"Tap Index","description":"The following is a list of taps curated by the community.

We leave it to the user to decide where, when, and how to purge state files. The current state can be found in the state directory of your remote storage (we refer to the latest state as the \\"active state\\"). Furthermore, state is automatically partitioned by environment. For example, if you have a tap named my-tap pushing data to my-target and you have an environment named dev-alex, the state file for that tap will be located at state/dev-alex/my-tap-to-my-target.json. Historical state files will be preserved at state/dev-alex/my-tap-to-my-target..json."},"tutorial-basics/congratulations":{"id":"tutorial-basics/congratulations","title":"Congratulations!","description":"You have just learned the basics of Alto."},"tutorial-basics/create-a-project":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-project","title":"Create a Project","description":"What is an Alto Project?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/environments":{"id":"tutorial-basics/environments","title":"Environments","description":"What is an Environment?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/example-configuration":{"id":"tutorial-basics/example-configuration","title":"Example Configuration","description":"What does a configuration file look like?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/plugin-configuration":{"id":"tutorial-basics/plugin-configuration","title":"Plugin Configuration","description":"What is a plugin?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/project-configuration":{"id":"tutorial-basics/project-configuration","title":"Project Configuration","description":"How is a project configured?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/secret-management":{"id":"tutorial-basics/secret-management","title":"Secret Management","description":"Where do I store secrets?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/tap-configuration":{"id":"tutorial-basics/tap-configuration","title":"Tap Configuration","description":"Adding a new tap to your project is as simple as adding a new key to the taps section of the alto.toml file.
